This is the online lab journal for my experiments exploring [Ada Palmer](https://www.adapalmer.com/)'s [Terra Ignota](https://www.adapalmer.com/series/terra-ignota/) series using techniques and tools from the __Digital Humanities__. In it I will:

- [document the journey](devlog.html),
- explain [how and why](about.html) I'm doing what I'm doing,
- post a dashboard of the progress made
- write up any discoveries made along the way, and 
- share the data collected which are not covered by the author's copyright.
