I put up the first demo visualization based on the `said.csv` data. Given how many words I've already written on this website to get to this point, the subject is rather ironic: verbosity, and in particular in asides to the reader. ðŸ˜…

## What It Took to Get Here

Clarifications:

- [Add some demo visualizations](https://github.com/syvwlch/Data-Ignota/issues/19)
	- Create new `viz` collection
		- [x] create collection
		- [x] create listing page
		- [x] add listing page to nav bar
		- [x] add RSS feed to feed menu
		- [x] add link to listing page to homepage
	- Write up inaugural post for new collection
		- Picked distribution of number of words as proxy for verbosity

## Lessons Learned

The `group_by()` + `summarise()` pattern requires an explicit assignment of a summary value any other column you want to keep, e.g using `mean()` here to keep the words when grouping by the unique line id:

```
said  %>%
  group_by(line) %>%
  summarize(words = mean(words), .groups = "drop")
```
