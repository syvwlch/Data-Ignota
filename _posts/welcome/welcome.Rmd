It's time to stand up a little website to share the results of my explorations into "data ignota", the digital edition I've been creating of _Ada Palmer_'s _Terra Ignota_ series. This is that website.

Since the ship I've launched on that digital ocean is built from __R__, it makes sense to build this site from the same timber. After some research, I've decided to use the `distill` package as the primary tool, and to publish via Github Pages.

## To-Do:
- [x] Create public repo at: https://github.com/syvwlch/Data-Ignota
- [x] Clone repo to R project (using Github Desktop, not R studio)
- [x] Create Distill blog within project
- [x] Add/update content
- [x] Build site & preview locally
- [x] Push to github
- [x] Setup github pages
- [x] Site is up at: https://syvwlch.github.io/Data-Ignota/
- [x] Add base_url: key to site.yml (used for RSS feed and share cards)
