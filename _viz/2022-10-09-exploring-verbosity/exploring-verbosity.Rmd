```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)

PATH_TO_SAID <- "../../data/said.csv"
said <- read.csv(PATH_TO_SAID)
```

Let's define, for now, verbosity as the tendency to use lots of words each time a character communicates with another. 

What visualizations of this concept can we generate from our `said.csv` file?

## Overall Verbosity

What does the distribution of the number of words per line look like?

```{r overall}
said  %>%
  group_by()
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = words)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 5)

```
